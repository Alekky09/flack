# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is modeled to look like Discord. There is only one main page/route.

All requirements have been fullfilled, along with my additional features such as:
    - users are able to change their username on the fly, whenever they want;
    - users can create up to 4 channels of their own;
    - direct message feature is added, by clicking on someones username a private chat is opened;

Sockets.js file contains all functions related to sockets;
Index.js contains all other functions.

Current work in progress is responsiveness of the app on smaller screens.
